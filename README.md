# Data Cleaning & Outlier Removal Project

This project demonstrates essential data preprocessing steps including handling missing values, removing outliers, and preparing a dataset for machine learning workflows.

## Main Tasks Covered
1. Load a CSV dataset.
2. Identify and handle missing values.
3. Drop columns with excessive missing data.
4. Impute missing values using the median.
5. Detect and remove outliers using Z-score.
6. Save the cleaned dataset for analysis or modeling.
